The Datathon took place in part of [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2020 (SSAC2020)](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/2020-conference/) and was supported by ESPN and Shottracker.

All the analysis was performed in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) environment, and the data was provided by [Shottracker repo](https://bitbucket.org/%7Bd5f3e782-25bf-4b80-9963-c8ad27dacd65%7D/).

For setting up the environment, please see the [google colab documentation](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) as well as the [Shottracker repo](https://bitbucket.org/%7Bd5f3e782-25bf-4b80-9963-c8ad27dacd65%7D/).

The demo shown here are prototypes, and more sophisticated, scalable pipeline is under development.
